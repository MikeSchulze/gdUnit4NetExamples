///     A simple example test class demonstrating the basic structure of gdUnit4Net tests.
///     This class serves as an introduction to gdUnit4Net testing framework, showing:
///     - How to mark a class as a test suite using [TestSuite]
///     - How to write basic test methods using [TestCase]
///     - How to use basic assertions with AssertThat()
///     - How to use 'using static' to simplify assertion syntax
///     Note: The 'using static GdUnit4.Assertions;' directive allows us to call
///     AssertThat() directly instead of writing Assertions.AssertThat(). This makes
///     test code cleaner and more readable.
///     This is the minimal example to get started with gdUnit4Net testing.
