# Git attributes file - controls how Git handles line endings and file processing
# This ensures consistent behavior across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)

# Normalize EOL for all files that Git considers text files.
# - text=auto: Let Git automatically detect text files
# - eol=lf: Convert line endings to LF (Unix-style) in the repository
# This prevents issues when team members use different operating systems
* text=auto eol=lf
