# Advanced Examples

Welcome to the advanced gdUnit4Net examples! This section covers sophisticated testing techniques, professional configurations, and complex scenarios you'll encounter in real-world Godot projects.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced examples, ensure you understand:
- Basic gdUnit4Net concepts from [Basics](../Basics/)
- Test project setup and configuration
- Environment variables vs configuration files
- Basic Godot object lifecycle and memory management

## Getting Started with Advanced Topics

**Ready for more complex testing?** Explore in this order:
1. [Configuration Management](Setup/TestWithRunnsettings/README.md) - Professional test configuration
2. [Complex Test Scenarios](Tests/) - Advanced testing patterns and techniques

## Advanced Topics Structure

The advanced examples are organized into:

```
├── Setup/              # Advanced project configurations
│   └── TestWithRunsettings/    # Professional .runsettings configuration
└── Tests/              # Complex testing scenarios and patterns
    ├── SignalTesting/          # Testing Godot signals and events
    ├── SceneManagement/        # Loading and testing scenes
    ├── AsyncTesting/           # Testing async operations
    ├── MockingAndStubs/        # Test doubles and dependency injection
    └── PerformanceTesting/     # Benchmarking and performance validation
```

## What Each Section Covers

### Setup/
Professional project configurations for production-ready test environments:
- **TestWithRunsettings**: Centralized configuration using .runsettings files
- Alternative to environment variables for team and CI/CD scenarios
- Multiple output formats and advanced logging
- Environment-specific configurations

### Tests/
Advanced testing patterns and complex scenarios:
- **Signal Testing**: Verifying Godot signal emissions and connections
- **Scene Management**: Loading, instantiating, and testing complex scenes
- **Async Testing**: Handling coroutines, timers, and async operations
- **Mocking and Stubs**: Using test doubles for isolated unit testing
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking and validating performance requirements
