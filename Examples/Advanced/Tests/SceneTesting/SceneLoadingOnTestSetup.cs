/// <summary>
///     Demonstrates advanced scene testing with setup and teardown lifecycle management.
///     This test class shows how to use gdUnit4Net's lifecycle attributes for efficient scene testing:
///     - [Before]/[After] for test suite-level setup and cleanup
///     - [BeforeTest]/[AfterTest] for individual test setup and cleanup
///     - Shared scene runner instance across multiple test methods
///     - Proper scene lifecycle management and validation
///     Key concepts demonstrated:
///     - Test lifecycle attributes and their execution order
///     - Shared resource management across test methods
///     - Scene state validation at different lifecycle stages
///     - Efficient scene reuse for multiple test cases
///     Lifecycle execution order:
///     1. [Before] - Once per test suite
///     2. [BeforeTest] - Before each test method
///     3. [TestCase] - Individual test method
///     4. [AfterTest] - After each test method
///     5. [After] - Once per test suite (after all tests)
///     This pattern is ideal for testing scenarios where:
///     - Multiple tests need the same scene setup
///     - Scene loading is expensive and should be reused
///     - You need to verify scene state consistency across tests.
