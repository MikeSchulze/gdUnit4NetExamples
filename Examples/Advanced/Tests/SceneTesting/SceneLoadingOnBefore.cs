///     Demonstrates efficient scene loading using suite-level setup with the [Before] attribute.
///     This example shows how to load a scene once for an entire test suite and reuse it
///     across multiple test methods, which is ideal when:
///     • Multiple tests examine the same scene without modifying it
///     • Scene loading is computationally expensive
///     • Tests focus on different aspects of the same scene configuration
///     • Memory allocation overhead should be minimized
///     <br />
///     Test Execution Lifecycle:
///     1. [Before] SetupScene() - Loads scene once before any test executes
///     2. [TestCase] methods - All tests share the same scene instance
///     3. [After] CleanupScene() - Verifies scene state after all tests complete
///     4. Dispose() - Final cleanup (demonstration only)
///     <br />
///     Advantages of Suite-Level Scene Loading:
///     • Significantly faster test execution (single scene load vs. per-test loading)
///     • Consistent baseline scene state across all tests
///     • Reduced memory fragmentation from repeated allocations
///     • Simplified test method implementation
///     <br />
///     Important Considerations:
///     • Tests MUST NOT modify the shared scene state
///     • All test methods must be compatible with the same scene setup
///     • Test isolation is reduced - failures may cascade between tests
///     • Consider per-test loading if scene state modifications are required
///     <br />
///     Alternative Patterns:
///     • Use [BeforeTest] for per-test scene loading when state isolation is needed
///     • Use scene snapshots/restoration for tests that need to modify scene state.
